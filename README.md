# React: Component Mounting and Unmounting

## Objectives

1. Describe what happens in the mounting phase of a React component's lifecycle
2. Describe what happens in the unmounting phase of a React component's
   lifecycle
3. Practice performing setup and teardown actions at the appropriate point in
   the React component lifecycle.

## Overview

This lab should give students a chance to practice mounting components —
requesting remote data, attaching to the DOM, etc. — and unmounting components —
invalidating timers, removing DOM references, etc.
